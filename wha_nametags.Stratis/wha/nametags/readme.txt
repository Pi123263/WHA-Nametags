	-	Tags will fade out after a certain distance.
	-	Lighting conditions and zoom level can affect visible distance.
	-	Changes nametag if target is talking use ACRE or TFAR.
	
	How to Implement:
	-	Move the wha folder (with \nametags) into your root mission folder.
	-	Configure your settings inside wha_nametags_CONFIG.sqf (Optional)
	-	Make a file called 'initPlayerLocal.sqf' or 'init.sqf' in the root mission folder.
	-	Put this code in 'initPlayerLocal.sqf' OR 'init.sqf': 
		[] execVM "wha\nametags\wha_nametags_init.sqf";
	-	Make a file called 'description.ext' in the root mission folder.
	-	Put this code in the 'description.ext' function header (CfgFunctions):
		#include "wha\nametags\functions\wha_nametags_functions.hpp"
	-	If you have ACE and want to disable ACE nametags just for your mission,
		the code for that is available in the description.ext of the Stratis
		mission provided with this script.
